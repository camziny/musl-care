## Database Schema Improvements

- Added direct fields for all job listing data instead of storing everything in the metadata field
- Properly structured the database to include:
  - Guardian information (name, image)
  - Children images
  - Contact information (phone, email, verification status)
  - Detailed location information (address, city, state, postal code)
  - Care details (care type, number of people, ages, availability)
  - Service requirements (as separate boolean fields)
  - Professional skills requirements
  - Preference filters

This improves:

- Data integrity and validation
- Query performance
- Code maintainability
- Future extensibility

The code also maintains backward compatibility by checking both direct fields and legacy metadata.
